# MockingBoard Monetization Strategy

## Non-Negotiables

1. **No ads. Ever.** Not display ads, not sponsored placements, not "promoted" content that looks like ads. The competitive landscape (PFN, OverTheCap) is drowning in ads — OTC is borderline unusable on mobile. This is a differentiator, not a sacrifice.

2. **No selling user data.** No third-party data sharing, no analytics resale, no "anonymized" data products. Users trust the platform with their drafting behavior, scouting opinions, and community identity. That trust is the product's foundation.

## Competitive Position

| Competitor    | Model                          | Pain Points                                                                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PFF           | Hard paywall on most content   | Casual fans bounce. Power users resent paying for basics. Free tier is a teaser, not a product. |
| PFN           | Ad-supported with premium tier | Ad experience degrades trust and UX. Content feels commoditized.                                |
| OverTheCap    | Ad-supported                   | Unusable on mobile — ads consume the entire viewport. Great data buried under terrible UX.      |
| MockDraftable | Ad-supported                   | Limited functionality. No community layer.                                                      |
| Fanspeak      | Freemium + ads                 | Dated UI. Ads on free tier. Premium is "remove ads" — not compelling.                           |

**MockingBoard's position**: Best-in-class UI/UX, no ads, and a more generous free tier than PFF. The free product should be better than what competitors charge for. Premium is for power users who want _more_, not users who want _less annoyance_.

### The PFF Cautionary Tale

PFF's mock draft simulator used to be fully free. It accounted for roughly 75% of their total site traffic. They moved it behind a paywall. The result: users didn't convert to paying subscribers — they left. Years later, the resentment is still palpable in the community. People who used to evangelize PFF now actively look for alternatives.

The lesson is clear: **mock drafting is the top of the funnel, not a monetizable feature.** Paywalling it doesn't capture revenue — it kills growth. MockingBoard will never repeat this mistake. All drafting — solo, multiplayer, all formats, all settings — stays free forever. This single decision is likely the most powerful competitive weapon in the entire strategy.

## Philosophy: The Generous Free Tier

Monetizing too much too early is the death of many platforms. The right model is the one Google used with Firestore: give users a _ton_ for free. By the time they hit the limits and start paying, they're already deeply invested. They've built their boards, written their reports, established their community presence. They don't feel squeezed — they feel like they've been getting a great deal and the paid tier is a natural upgrade.

The free tier is not a loss leader. It's the growth engine. Every free user is a potential Pro subscriber, a content creator, a community member who pulls in friends. The goal is to make MockingBoard the obvious default for anyone who cares about the NFL draft — and then let the power users self-select into Pro because they _want_ more, not because they're annoyed into it.

## Revenue Streams

### 1. MockingBoard Pro (Individual Subscription)

The primary revenue stream. Freemium with a generous floor.

#### Free Tier (Must Be Excellent)

The free tier is the growth engine. It needs to be genuinely good — not a crippled teaser.

- Unlimited solo mock drafts (all formats, all settings)
- Multiplayer mock drafts (create and join)
- Full big board builder with snapshots
- Player pages with all community data
- Write scouting reports (limited to 10/month)
- Submit video breakdowns
- Public profile + follow system
- Community browse and discovery
- View all leaderboards
- PDF draft guide export (limited: first 32 players, default formatting only — no custom cover, no watermark removal, no community report integration)
- Guest draft mode (no account needed)

#### Pro Tier (~$6–8/month or ~$50–60/year)

Target: serious mock drafters, community scouts, and content consumers who draft weekly.

- **Unlimited scouting reports** (remove monthly cap)
- **Advanced board tools**: rapid position-group generation, board comparison (vs. friends, vs. scouts, vs. consensus)
- **Full PDF draft guide exports**: unlimited players, custom covers, watermark removal, community report integration, all depth levels
- **Draft analytics**: post-draft team grades, reach/value analysis, historical pick patterns
- **Preference engine**: full scouting profile, prospect recommendations, draft tendencies
- **Priority in community**: Pro badge on profile, reports surfaced higher in player pages
- **Advanced leaderboard filters**: by year, by position, vs. specific users/analysts
- **Draft room customization**: custom timer settings, extended rounds, private room features
- **Historical access**: full draft history across all years (free tier keeps current year + 1 prior)
- **API access**: personal API key for exporting your data (boards, reports, draft history)

#### Pricing Psychology

- Annual plan should feel like a clear win (~30-40% discount over monthly)
- Price should be _less_ than PFF ($10/month) while offering comparable or superior functionality
- Free trial: 14 days of Pro for new signups (no credit card required)
- Student discount: 50% off with .edu verification

### 2. MockingBoard Team Plan (Group Subscription)

A massive differentiator. PFF loses significant revenue to password sharing — friends and Discord communities routinely split a single account. Rather than fighting this behavior, monetize it directly.

#### How It Works

- A group of friends (3–6 people) shares a single Team Plan at a group discount
- Each member gets their own full Pro account — no shared credentials, no feature compromises
- One person manages billing; members are invited via link or email
- Members can leave and be replaced without disrupting the plan

#### Pricing

- ~$4–5/person/month (vs. $6–8 solo) — meaningful savings that makes splitting feel like a win, not a workaround
- Minimum 3 members, maximum 6
- Annual option with same ~30-40% discount as individual Pro
- If a member leaves and isn't replaced within the billing cycle, remaining members split the cost (or plan downgrades)

#### Why This Is a Differentiator

- **Legitimizes sharing**: instead of one PFF login passed around a Discord server, everyone gets their own account with their own boards, reports, and draft history
- **Network effect**: a team plan means 3–6 people committed to the platform, not just 1. They draft together, scout together, and pull in more friends
- **Higher lifetime value**: team plans churn less than individual plans because social accountability keeps people subscribed
- **Competitive moat**: PFF doesn't offer this. If MockingBoard does, friend groups have a reason to switch _together_

### 3. Creator Program (Revenue Share)

Aligns incentives: creators drive users to the platform, platform shares revenue with creators.

#### How It Works

- Creators with verified profiles and consistent contributions qualify
- Platform tracks creator impact: report views, board views, follower growth, video engagement
- Revenue share from Pro subscriptions attributed to creator-driven signups and engagement
- Payout threshold: $25 minimum (monthly cycle)

#### Creator Tiers

| Tier             | Criteria                                           | Benefits                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Contributor      | 10+ reports, public profile                        | Attribution on content, profile badge                                                                          |
| Verified Creator | 50+ reports OR 100+ followers, consistent activity | Revenue share eligible, priority in community feed, early access to features                                   |
| Partner          | Top 1% by engagement, approved application         | Higher revenue share rate, co-marketing, featured placement on community page, direct product feedback channel |

#### Why This Works

- Brett and similar creators have audiences but limited monetization tools for scouting content
- MockingBoard becomes a monetization channel for their work, not just a hosting platform
- Creators are incentivized to drive their audiences to MockingBoard
- No exclusivity requirements — creators keep their YouTube/Twitter/blog presence

#### Timing: Possibly Earlier Than Expected

The conventional wisdom is to wait for scale before building a creator program. But if Brett can push MockingBoard out to his network of content creator friends — people who already have audiences and are looking for a platform that treats their work seriously — the creator program becomes a _launch accelerant_ rather than a late-stage feature. A fully built creator platform handed to a connected early adopter could drive meaningful organic growth before paid marketing ever enters the picture. Worth evaluating whether to fast-track this alongside or immediately after the subscription foundation.

### 4. MockingBoard for Teams / B2B (Future)

Potential revenue stream once the platform proves product-market fit with consumers.

#### Media Outlets

- White-label draft tools for sports media sites (embed drafts, boards, player cards)
- Syndicated player data and community grades
- Licensing of the draft engine for media company custom experiences

#### NFL Teams / Agencies

- Private team workspaces with shared boards and internal scouting reports
- Trade scenario modeling (Phase 9 GM Mode as a professional tool)
- Prospect tracking across combine/pro day/game tape

#### Pricing: Custom / Enterprise

Not worth building until consumer product has traction. Listed here as a long-term option.

### 5. Seasonal Events & Tournaments (Micro-Revenue)

- **Draft accuracy challenges**: entry fee ($2-5), prize pool from entries, platform takes small cut
- **Community draft tournaments**: bracket-style mock draft competitions
- **Draft week live events**: special draft-along experiences with creators

Low priority. Only worth exploring if community reaches critical mass.

## What Stays Free Forever

These are commitments, not current pricing that might change:

- **All mock drafting** — solo, multiplayer, all formats, all settings, no exceptions. This is the core product and will never be gated.
- Big board builder (full drag-and-drop, snapshots, comparison to own history)
- Player pages with all community data
- Scouting reports (10/month — generous enough for casual scouts, low enough to convert power users)
- PDF draft guide export (limited: first 32 players, default formatting)
- Submit video breakdowns
- Community profiles, follow system, and social features
- Leaderboard participation and viewing
- Discord bot integration
- Guest draft mode (no account needed)
- Dark/light themes

## Conversion Strategy

The goal is not to annoy free users into paying. The goal is to make Pro so valuable that power users _want_ it.

### Soft Conversion Points

- After generating a PDF: "Unlock custom covers and community report integration with Pro"
- After hitting scouting report cap: "You've written 10 reports this month — upgrade for unlimited"
- On board comparison page: "Compare your board to any community scout with Pro"
- After completing a draft: "Unlock full draft analytics and team grades with Pro"
- After a multiplayer draft with 3+ friends: "Draft together regularly? Save with a Team Plan"

### What NOT to Do

- No feature degradation for free users over time
- No "you used to have this for free" bait-and-switch
- No dark patterns (hard-to-cancel, hidden auto-renewal, confusing pricing)
- No paywalling community-generated content that was submitted freely
- No interstitial "upgrade" modals that block usage

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Aligns with Roadmap Phase 7)

- Stripe integration for subscription management
- Pro/Free tier gating middleware
- Pricing page (individual + team plan)
- Account management (upgrade, downgrade, cancel)
- Billing history

### Phase 2: Team Plan (Alongside Phase 1)

- Team plan creation and member invitation flow
- Billing owner management (add/remove members, handle departures)
- Per-member Pro account provisioning
- Team dashboard (members, billing, plan status)

### Phase 3: Creator Program (Potentially Fast-Tracked)

- Creator application and verification flow
- Engagement tracking and attribution
- Payout system integration (Stripe Connect)
- Creator dashboard with earnings and metrics
- Evaluate launching alongside or immediately after Phase 1 if Brett's creator network is ready

### Phase 4: Optimization

- A/B test pricing
- Analyze conversion funnels
- Adjust free/Pro boundaries based on usage data
- Introduce annual plan discounts and promotions

## Financial Targets (Rough)

These are directional, not commitments.

| Milestone                  | Target                                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Break even on hosting      | ~200 Pro subscribers at $6/month                 |
| Sustainable solo operation | ~1,000 Pro subscribers                           |
| Creator program viable     | ~5,000 Pro subscribers (enough revenue to share) |
| Full-time potential        | ~10,000+ Pro subscribers                         |

Hosting costs scale with usage (Firestore reads, Cloud Run, Firebase Auth). At small scale, GCP free tier and Firebase Spark plan cover most costs. The break-even point is low.

## Resolved Decisions

- **PDF draft guide**: free tier gets limited export (32 players, default formatting). Pro unlocks full customization (unlimited players, custom covers, watermark removal, community report integration). PDF is the primary "taste of Pro" conversion point.
- **Scouting report cap**: 10/month for free users. Generous enough that casual scouts never feel limited. Power users who write more than 10/month are exactly the audience that will pay for Pro.
- **Drafting**: entirely free. All formats, all settings, solo and multiplayer. No Pro-only draft settings. This is non-negotiable — see PFF cautionary tale above.
- **Team plan**: yes, build it. Huge differentiator. Legitimizes the password-sharing behavior that already costs competitors revenue.

## Open Questions

- What's the ideal team plan size range? (3–6 proposed, but could be 2–8)
- Should the creator program be fast-tracked to launch alongside subscriptions, or staged after?
- Is the $4–5/person/month team pricing compelling enough vs. just splitting a single PFF login?
- What engagement metrics best attribute Pro signups to specific creators?
